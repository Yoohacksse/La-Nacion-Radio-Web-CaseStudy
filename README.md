# 📻 Case Study on La Nación Radio - Web App

La Nación Radio Web is the digital platform of La Nación, the largest news outlet in Venezuela. As part of its expansion into podcasts and online radio, I worked on the full restructuring of the website using WordPress + Elementor, creating new content flows, custom archives, and backend structures to integrate seamlessly with the mobile app.

## 🌍 Overview

The project involved building the new website for La Nación Radio with a modern design (provided by the client) and implemented via Elementor. Custom post types and taxonomies were created for Regions, Programs, Hosts, Articles, Companies, and Ads, with interlinked relationships to ensure consistency between radio hosts, programs, and app content. Dynamic templates were developed to keep content creation simple for administrators.
